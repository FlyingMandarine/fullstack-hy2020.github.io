<div class="intro">

On the course previous sections we used MongoDB for storing data, which is so called NoSQL database. NoSQL databases became very common in just over 10 years ago, when internet scaling started to produce problems for relational databases that utilized the older generation SQL query language.

Relational databases have since then experienced the new beginning. Problem with scalability have been partially resolved and have also adopted some of the features from NoSQL database. On this section we explore different NodeJS applications that use relational databases, the database is the number one PostgreSQL in the open source world.
